short_desc: >
                RPC-Heat-ELK delivers a deployable configuration of Elastic Search, Logstash 
                and Kibana using the Heat orchestration engine available in any Rackspace 
                OpenStack Private Cloud.

long_desc: >
                The ELK stack consists of three distinct projects that work together to provide
                real-time analysis and visualization for almost any type of data.

                Elasticsearch is a real-time search and analytics engine built with reliability and scalability in mind. 
                It provides more than the classic full-text search through APIs and a number of clients for most popular languages.

                Logstash acts as a middleman by taking logs or event data from a system converting them to JSON objects and storing them
                elsewhere. In the ELK stack logstash saves all data in elasticsearch.

                Kibana is the visualization engine for elasticsearch. It is highly customizable and allows users to save, share and export data.
                Queries are displayed in real time allowing humans to easily view and understand large amounts of data.

architecture: >
                With a deployment driven by the OpenStack Heat 
                orchestration engine and Salt configuration management, we are able to deliver 
                ELK stack as a repeatable, scalable, production-ready deployment.

design_specs:
            - >
                Elasticsearch nodes are automatically clustered. Each node provides extra resiliency
                and resources for higher rates of traffic.
            - > 
                Load for all ELK services is balanced between available servers.
            - >
                Logstash configuration can be managed and applied via salt. This allows users to quickly customize 
                the sources and format of input data in a way that works best for their system.
            - >
                Network isolation and security group isolation at various levels within the stack 
                provide enhanced Cloud security.
